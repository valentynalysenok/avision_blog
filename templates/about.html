                                Outer space, or simply space, is the expanse that exists beyond the Earth and between
                                celestial bodies. Outer space is not completely empty—it is a hard vacuum containing a
                                low density of particles, predominantly a plasma of hydrogen and helium, as well as
                                electromagnetic radiation, magnetic fields, neutrinos, dust, and cosmic rays. The
                                baseline temperature of outer space, as set by the background radiation from the Big
                                Bang, is 2.7 kelvins (−270.45 °C; −454.81 °F).[1] The plasma between galaxies accounts
                                for about half of the baryonic (ordinary) matter in the universe; it has a number
                                density of less than one hydrogen atom per cubic metre and a temperature of millions of
                                kelvins.[2] Local concentrations of matter have condensed into stars and galaxies.
                                Studies indicate that 90% of the mass in most galaxies is in an unknown form, called
                                dark matter, which interacts with other matter through gravitational but not
                                electromagnetic forces.[3][4] Observations suggest that the majority of the mass-energy
                                in the observable universe is dark energy, a type of vacuum energy that is poorly
                                understood.[5][6] Intergalactic space takes up most of the volume of the universe, but
                                even galaxies and star systems consist almost entirely of empty space.

                                Outer space does not begin at a definite altitude above the Earth's surface. However,
                                the Kármán line, an altitude of 100 km (62 mi) above sea level,[7][8] is conventionally
                                used as the start of outer space in space treaties and for aerospace records keeping.
                                The framework for international space law was established by the Outer Space Treaty,
                                which entered into force on 10 October 1967. This treaty precludes any claims of
                                national sovereignty and permits all states to freely explore outer space. Despite the
                                drafting of UN resolutions for the peaceful uses of outer space, anti-satellite weapons
                                have been tested in Earth orbit.

                                Humans began the physical exploration of space during the 20th century with the advent
                                of high-altitude balloon flights. This was followed by manned rocket flights and, then,
                                manned Earth orbit, first achieved by Yuri Gagarin of the Soviet Union in 1961. Due to
                                the high cost of getting into space, manned spaceflight has been limited to low Earth
                                orbit and the Moon. On the other hand, unmanned spacecraft have reached all of the known
                                planets in the Solar System.

                                Outer space represents a challenging environment for human exploration because of the
                                hazards of vacuum and radiation. Microgravity also has a negative effect on human
                                physiology that causes both muscle atrophy and bone loss. In addition to these health
                                and environmental issues, the economic cost of putting objects, including humans, into
                                space is very high.

The source was the most exotic merger of two black holes detected yet\u2014a pair in which one weighed more than three times as much as the other. Because of the stark mass imbalance, the collision generated gravitational waves at multiple frequencies, in a harmony&nbsp;Elvis fans would recognize. The chord also confirms a prediction of Albert Einstein\u2019s theory of gravity, or general relativity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such mismatched mass events could help theorists figure out how pairs of black holes form in the first place. \u201cAnything that seems to be at the edge of our predictions is most interesting,\u201d says Chris Belczynski, a gravitational theorist at the Polish Academy of Sciences, who was not involved in the observation. But the one event is \u201cnot quite in the regime where you can tell the different formation [routes] apart.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Physicists <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/02/gravitational-waves-einstein-s-ripples-spacetime-spotted-first-time\">first detected gravitational waves in 2015</a>, when the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), a pair of detectors in Washington and Louisiana, spotted two black holes spiraling into each other, generating infinitesimal ripples in spacetime. Two years later, the Virgo detector&nbsp;near Pisa, Italy, joined the hunt, and by August 2017, the detectors had bagged a total of 10 black hole mergers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All involved pairs of black holes with roughly equal masses, says Maya Fishbach, a physicist and LIGO member at the University of Chicago. But on 12 April 2019, the three detectors detected a black hole merger 2.4 billion light-years away in which one weighed 30 solar masses and the other just eight, says Fishbach, who reported on the event at the <a href=\"https://aps-april.onlineeventpro.freeman.com/\">American Physical Society\u2019s online April meeting</a>. \u201cThis is the first event in which we can confidently say the mass-ratio is not one,\u201d she says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ordinarily, two spiraling black holes pump out gravitational waves concentrated at a single frequency: double the rate at which they orbit each other. That doubling arises because of the matched masses of the black holes. Every half orbit they return to a position that\u2019s effectively identical to their original one. But if the black holes have distinctly different masses, then general relativity predicts that they should also generate weaker waves at higher frequencies, or overtones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next strongest note sung by the pair should vibrate at three times the orbital frequency, or 1.5&nbsp;times the main gravitational wave frequency. If the main frequency were a C on a piano, the overtone would be the next higher G\u2014a perfect fifth, and the interval of the first two notes in the melody of Presley\u2019s hit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSaxhqJG1Mw\">\u201cI Can\u2019t Help Falling in Love with You.\u201d</a> That is what the LIGO and Virgo researchers detected, says Maximiliano Isi, a physicist and LIGO member at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who also spoke at the meeting. The overtone rang roughly as loudly as predicted by general relativity, Isi says. \u201cEinstein prevails again.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such oddball events might help researchers figure out how the black holes pair in the first place. That\u2019s a puzzle because it\u2019s not obvious how such big black holes can form so close together. Theorists have two general ideas. The pairs could originate from a pair of orbiting massive stars, which each collapse into black holes at the ends of their lives. Alternatively, in so-called dynamical models, the black holes might form completely separately and find each other across space and time, a scenario more likely in globular clusters, the dense clumps of stars found in the outer reaches of galaxies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Either scenario can probably account for the mismatched black holes in this event, Belczynski says. \u201cIf it [the mass ratio] had been 10-to-one&nbsp;I would have bet on the dynamical models,\u201d he says, as binary star systems generally don\u2019t form with such skewed ratios. Fishbach agrees that the single event isn\u2019t enough to rule out one scenario or the other. But she says that if LIGO and Virgo spot more mismatched events, the statistical distributions could suggest which scenario is more likely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the event could have a more complex origin, says Emanuele Berti, a gravitational wave astronomer at Johns Hopkins University. The fact that the one black hole is so much heavier than the other and appears to be spinning fast suggest that it, too, was the product of a merger. \u201cIt looks quiet&nbsp;like the product of a multiple-generation merger,\u201d he says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More peculiar collisions might be waiting among the dozens of recorded events that researchers have yet to analyze. LIGO and Virgo\u2019s observing run three, which went from 1 April 2019 to 26 March, picked up 56 new gravitational wave events, more than five times the previous total. LIGO and Virgo researchers had hoped to finish a global analysis of roughly half that data set by now, but the coronavirus pandemic delayed them, says Patrick Brady, a physicist at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, and spokesperson for the LIGO scientific collaboration. Belczynski says he\u2019s anxious to see those results. \u201cI\u2019m just sitting here with my students, my entire group, waiting for this paper.\u201d</p>", "image": "posts/black_hole_collisions.jpg", "category": 8, "publish": "2020-04-20T15:45:47Z", "created": "2020-04-21T15:49:30.155Z", "updated": "2020-04-21T15:49:30.155Z", "status": "published", "likes": [], "dislikes": []}}, {"model": "posts.post", "pk": 58, "fields": {"title": "Space travel can seriously change your brain", "slug": "space-travel-can-seriously-change-your-brain-1587485664", "author": 5, "body": "<p>It turns out that spending time in space can change your brain (and you might have to be spun around to prevent it). </p><p>Researchers have been exploring how spaceflight <a href=\"https://www.space.com/43126-space-travel-astronaut-health-immune-system-cancer.html\" target=\"_blank\">can affect human physiology and human health </a>for as long as we have been working to launch people to space.

Medical evaluations on Earth have revealed that astronauts' optic nerves swell and some experience retinal hemorrhage and other structural changes to their eyes. </p><p>Scientists suspect that these vision issues are caused by increased \"intracranial pressure,\" or pressure in the head, during spaceflight. In a new study led by Dr. Larry Kramer, a radiologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, researchers have found evidence that this pressure does, in fact, increase in microgravity. </p><p>In this study, the team performed brain <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/39074-what-is-an-mri.html\" target=\"_blank\"><u>MRI</u></a> (magnetic resonance imaging, a technique that uses specialized scanners to image parts of the body using magnetic fields) on 11 astronauts (10 men and one woman) both before and after they traveled to space and for up to a year after their return. These MRI images showed that, with long-duration exposure to microgravity, the brain swells and cerebrospinal fluid, which surrounds the brain and spinal cord, increases in volume. </p><p>These findings support the theory that spaceflight increases pressure in the head which researchers think could be tied to issues with astronaut vision, Kramer told Space.com.</p><p>Additionally, Kramer and his colleagues found that the pituitary gland, also changes with exposure to microgravity, Kramer said. They found that the gland became compressed, it changed in height and shape which, as Kramer said, this is a sign of increased pressure in the head. </p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://www.space.com/43285-astronaut-health-medicine-in-space.html\"><strong>Astronauts Use 'Smart Shirt' and Ultrasounds to Monitor Health </strong></a></p><p class=\"mid__article\"></p><div id=\"futr_botr_E0PcsuFR_XzKn4M6Y_div\" class=\"future__jwplayer\"><div id=\"botr_E0PcsuFR_XzKn4M6Y_div\"></div></div><p>The researchers also found that these effects, the swelling of the brain alongside the compressing pituitary gland and the pressure in the head, was still present a year after the astronauts returned from space. That duration suggests that these effects could be long-lasting, Kramer said. However, further study is needed to evaluate exactly how microgravity affects the brain over an astronaut's lifetime and how this might vary between people, Kramer said. </p><p>Scientists have a number of theories about why the brain swells in space, but what Kramer called \"one of the most compelling,\" is that without gravity, the fluids in our body that usually circulate evenly travel up toward the head and away from the feet, he said. \"The blood that normally pools in the extremities redistributes toward the head,\" he said. \"It's not something that we normally experience on Earth unless you're sort of standing on your hands.\"</p><p>Researchers are also working to develop what spaceflight experts call \"countermeasures,\" or techniques that could be used to reduce these negative effects. </p><p>To test countermeasures, research subjects are put on bed rest with their heads tilted downward to simulate the fluid shift scientists believe happens in microgravity. In this position, researchers have found that the optic nerve swells and seen other physical effects that are also seen in spaceflight. \"If we can prevent those [effects] in the bed-rest studies, then potentially we can prevent those in microgravity,\" Kramer said.</p><p>One of the countermeasures that researchers are experimenting with is reminiscent of the revolving space station in the sci-fi film \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" Kramer said. The countermeasure would \"spin an astronaut around for a certain portion of the day, just moving the blood through the body and back towards the legs,\" like an artificial gravity, Kramer said. </p><p>Another countermeasure scientists think may help is a specialized suit for the feet and legs that would help to maintain their fluid levels. </p>", "image": "posts/space_travel.jpg", "category": 9, "publish": "2020-04-19T15:53:09Z", "created": "2020-04-21T16:14:24.187Z", "updated": "2020-04-21T16:16:20.542Z", "status": "published", "likes": [2], "dislikes": []}}, {"model": "posts.post", "pk": 62, "fields": {"title": "This is the brightest supernova ever seen", "slug": "this-is-the-brightest-supernova-ever-seen-1587494203", "author": 5, "body": "<p>You\u2019re looking at an artist\u2019s conception of&nbsp;the brightest supernova ever recorded, a celestial explosion so massive it has blotted out the light of its surrounding galaxy, 4 billion light-years away.

They decided to power down the crew module, as they would need to preserve it for re-entry, and they evacuated to the lunar module, nicknamed Aquarius, and used it as a \"lifeboat\" out in space. </p><p>They planned to travel around the far side of the moon and use the moon's orbit as a \"slingshot\" to help them get back to Earth. Mission Control was concerned that, if they were to instead just turn around and head straight back, their engine (they weren't sure how damaged it was) might not be able to make it. </p><p>But Aquarius was only meant to carry two astronauts down to the lunar surface and back, and now it was carting three grown men around the far side of the moon. This posed a number of issues as, not only were the astronauts cramped, they noticed that carbon dioxide levels were starting to rise in the air. </p><p>Lithium hydroxide canisters aboard both the lunar module and the command module were designed to \"scrub\" or remove carbon dioxide from the air. But the canisters on Aquarius couldn't handle the extra carbon dioxide from a third passenger. The crew acted quickly, grabbing other canisters from the command module, but those canisters were a different shape and didn't quite fit into the air filtration system aboard Aquarius. </p><p>But the crew needed to make it work, so they used things including spacesuit hoses, plastic bags and duct tape. Eventually, they got the canisters from the command module to fit in Aquarius. And, voila: a do-it-yourself air filtration system. </p><p>About an hour before they reentered Earth's atmosphere, the team jettisoned the lunar module, saying goodbye to the capsule that kept them alive during their unbelievable journey around the moon. </p><p>After bidding adieu to Aquarius, the crew buckled into Odyssey and prepared for an intense re-entry and descent. Ionized air around the module created a complete communication blackout for over four minutes as the craft was descending. NASA still thought that there could be an issue with the craft's parachutes or shields and was anxiously waiting to hear from the astronauts. </p><p>So, when the crew finally re-established contact with NASA and let them know that they'd splashed down safely and successfully in the Pacific Ocean on April 17, everyone breathed a heavy sigh of relief. </p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.space.com/apollo-13-exhibit-cosmosphere-museum.html\">Apollo 13 50th anniversary exhibit to launch new space rental service</a></li><li>", "image": "posts/apollo_.jpg", "category": 11, "publish": "2020-04-18T18:39:59Z", "created": "2020-04-21T18:41:52.083Z", "updated": "2020-04-21T18:55:39.044Z", "status": "published", "likes": [], "dislikes": []}}, {"model": "posts.post", "pk": 64, "fields": {"title": "No star, no problem: Radioactivity could make otherwise frozen planets habitable", "slug": "no-star-no-problem-radioactivity-could-make-otherwise-frozen-planets-habitable-1587496168", "author": 5, "body": "<p>Not too close, but not too far.

They then modeled the surface temperatures of planets with different masses and radionuclide abundances to determine whether water, ammonia, and ethane\u2014three solvents found in the Solar System\u2014could exist as liquids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warming a planet enough to liquify water <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab68e5\">requires roughly 1000 times Earth\u2019s abundance of both types of radioactive isotopes</a>, Lingman and Loeb report in <cite>The Astrophysical Journal Letters</cite>. Lingam and Loeb found that planets with the same mass as Earth but with about 100 times the abundance of radionuclides would pump out enough heat to keep ethane liquid over hundreds of millions of years. The radiation levels on such worlds would be hundreds of times higher than the time-averaged doses Chernobyl residents experienced after the Ukrainian nuclear disaster in 1986, Lingam and Loeb estimated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It\u2019s unlikely that multicellular life would survive such irradiation, Lingam says. But some of Earth\u2019s most extreme microbes would have better than a fighting chance. For instance, <em>Deinococcus radiodurans</em>, a highly radiation-resistant bacterium, would do just fine, Lingam says. \u201c<em>Deinococcus radiodurans</em> is a really crazy organism.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Could a single planet amass such a large stockpile of radionuclides? That\u2019s the key question, Loeb says. Such worlds, if they existed in our own Galaxy, would probably have to be born near the center of the Milky Way. That\u2019s because heavy elements such as uranium and thorium are thought to be produced in collisions between neutron stars, and such collisions are more likely to occur in the densely crowded center of the Galaxy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But finding such a planet would come as a surprise because it\u2019s so unlike the other worlds in our solar system, says Tim Lichtenberg, a planetary scientist at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the research. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to argue that it\u2019s impossible. But it\u2019s definitely not the norm.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If one of these worlds does exist, the James Webb Space Telescope, slated to launch in 2021, might be able to spot it by virtue of the radiation it would emit. But one of the telescope\u2019s cameras would need roughly 10 days to detect the signal, which would be strongest in the infrared, Lingam and Loeb calculated. And that exposure estimate could vary wildly depending on the planet\u2019s age, radionuclide abundance, and mass. \u201cThere are so many unknowns,\u201d Lingam says. \u201cWe haven\u2019t said the last word.\u201d</p>", "image": "posts/planets.jpg", "category": 12, "publish": "2020-04-17T19:03:40Z", "created": "2020-04-21T19:09:28.960Z", "updated": "2020-04-21T19:09:28.960Z", "status": "published", "likes": [], "dislikes": []}}, {"model": "posts.category", "pk": 7, "fields": {"title": "Scientists", "slug": "scientists-1587482791", "created": "2020-04-21T15:26:31.242Z", "updated": "2020-04-21T15:26:31.242Z"}}, {"model": "posts.category", "pk": 8, "fields": {"title": "Astrophysics", "slug": "astrophysics-1587482885", "created": "2020-04-21T15:28:05.155Z", "updated": "2020-04-21T15:28:05.155Z"}}, {"model": "posts.category", "pk": 9, "fields": {"title": "Spaceflight", "slug": "spaceflight-1587484362", "created": "2020-04-21T15:52:42.987Z", "updated": "2020-04-21T15:52:42.987Z"}}, {"model": "posts.category", "pk": 10, "fields": {"title": "Stars", "slug": "stars-1587493780", "created": "2020-04-21T18:29:40.434Z", "updated": "2020-04-21T18:29:40.434Z"}}, {"model": "posts.category", "pk": 11, "fields": {"title": "History", "slug": "history-1587494414", "created": "2020-04-21T18:40:14.680Z", "updated": "2020-04-21T18:40:14.680Z"}}, {"model": "posts.category", "pk": 12, "fields": {"title": "Planets", "slug": "planets-1587495865", "created": "2020-04-21T19:04:25.627Z", "updated": "2020-04-21T19:04:25.627Z"}}]
